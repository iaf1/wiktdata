- Apparently, sometimes <li> tags list dialects (e.g. Fula for 'dictionary'). Those entries are lost. fix that.

- When there is a main language AND dialects:
e.g. (english to french 'angry')

    Fix the representation: 'french-french' should come first when calling Word().translation('french')

- Organize project files

- Implement Russian parser
